useState always accepts two values:
    -the state variable thats based upon the initial value we pass into it- in this case,
    undefined
    -a function defined as setSessionToken. setSessionToken is our means of changing the value of our state variable

    -naming convention for state variables is always what our state variable is called, and then 'set'_____


Naming convention for components is to start with a Capitol letter.
